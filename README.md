# Limitations

- **Batch/ Cron Job Schelduer**: Due to using free tiers of various services, not all functionalities may perform optimally. Specifically, the cron job designed to save user data will only execute once daily at 23:59. This means that user asset data is recorded at the end of each day.

- **Stock API provided by FinnHub & Polygon.ai**: The APIs provided by FinnHub and Polygon.ai might have restrictions or limitations in their free tiers, potentially affecting the frequency and depth of data retrieval.
